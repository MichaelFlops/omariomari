    If we really have someone else’s best interest in mind, which we should, because they are our interests as well, then we should have nothing to hide.  In a mutually beneficial interaction, the more knowledge the both sides have about each other’s interests, the more that they can work for each other’s interests, which means a more efficient transaction.

    "A non-profit organization is inherently 'opaque' because at the end of the day, it's still for-profit. It's common knowledge that they usually are. I think it's interesting to promote extreme transparency through a structure that itself is not very transparent. There's certainly a right way to do it, and it's a great safeguard for the team, but I think it seems counter-intuitive to the whole #transparency postulate." -Asha

    Github development workflow:  How to use Github issue tracking poses an interesting problem for our organizational structure.  Creating issues for other people to do seems to contradict our "no authority" thing that we've got going on, however, we need to do some amount of issue tracking to ensure that, for example, two people don't work on the same feature simultaneously.  To mitigate this threat I think we should create issues, but only assign them to ourselves.  This is also nice because it allows us to retroactively sort through who worked on what when we divvy up the pay.  
  </h3>
    Of course there are problems with this that we will face down the road, for example we need to issue track bugs that are hard to reproduce, but we don't want to just dump the responsibility of solving that bug to the person that discovered it.  This is certainly a problem that will have to be addressed down the road, but I think we can solve those problems on-the-fly for now and then maybe build some sort of internal system for doing that down the road (that involves compensating people more for jobs that no one wants to do).  For now though, it seems like only creating issues for yourself is the philosophically correct starting point.
